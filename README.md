# Points Management API

## Overview
The Points Management API is a FastAPI-based application designed to manage transactions of points for users, allowing them to add and spend points efficiently while ensuring no payer's balance goes negative. 
## Features
- **Add Points**: Users can add points through a POST request to the `/add` endpoint.
- **Spend Points**: Users can spend points through a POST request to the `/spend` endpoint, adhering to the rules of spending the oldest points first and preventing any payer from going negative.
- **Get Balance**: Users can retrieve the current balance for all payers through a GET request to the `/balance` endpoint.

## Technologies Used
- **FastAPI**: A modern web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.
- **Pydantic**: Data validation and settings management using Python type annotations.
- **Python**: The programming language used for developing the API.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vishak-V/Fetch-Points
   cd Fetch-Points
   ```
2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Start the FastAPI application:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```
   (Assuming the main file is named `main.py`)
2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs` to access the interactive API documentation generated by FastAPI.

## API Endpoints

### Add Points
- **Endpoint**: `/add`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Request Body**:
    ```json
    {
        "payer": "DANNON",
        "points": 5000,
        "timestamp": "2020-11-02T14:00:00Z"
    }
    ```

### Spend Points
- **Endpoint**: `/spend`
- **Method**: `POST`
- **Request Body**:
    ```json
    {
        "points": 5000
    }
    ```

### Get Balance
- **Endpoint**: `/balance`
- **Method**: `GET`

## Advantages
- High performance and scalability of FastAPI.
- Automatic generation of API documentation.
- Robust data validation with Pydantic.

## Disadvantages
- Limited community resources compared to more established frameworks.
- In-memory data storage results in loss of data on server restart.
- Inefficiencies in processing time due to transaction management.
